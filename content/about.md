I was born under the name of *Muhammad Surga Savero*, 
from my early childhood i was fond of games, technology,
things keep repeating in my head, how it's done, how it was built,
until one day i grind a lot, and someone else achieve the same result or surpassing as i was without doing lots of work,
turns out he's cheating the game, that was how my passion start, i decide one day i'll learn
to create such intricate way to fool the game, and not wasting my time in a delusional loop of grinding
