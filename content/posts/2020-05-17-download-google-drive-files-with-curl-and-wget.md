description: A Method to download Google Drive Files to your server with WGET / CURL
---
I need to mirror some *Public Google Drive Files* to my server, since i got slow connection, sometimes the files which I tried to download can't get resumed if something happened during the process, 

It was real pain to re-download it from the beginning, what a mood-breaking moment.

One of the solution was to keep the files somewhere where you can access and direct download it with full speed, I've been googling for a while, and i couldn't found a way which 'still' works.

So I tried to hack it myself with my way

##### Here's what I've done to download Google Drive Files to my server:

1. Go to the **link of file** you want to download and **Inspect Element,**
2. Click **"DOWLOAD ANYWAY"** button while you're on the **Network Tab** of *Inspect Window*

   ![Google Drive Inspect Element](/img/gdrive1.png "https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=[FILE_ID]&export=download")
3. There are few request on server made by the click you triggered, find the one where the **"Content-Type"** header match the file you tried to download, as example ("*Application/binary*") ("*Application/x-rar"*)

   ![Network Request MIME Type](/img/gdrive2.png "Server Request of the file")
4. After you found the right *Link Server Request* which has the right Content/MIME type as your file, 

   for UNIX:

   > `Right-click > Copy > Copy all as curl (bash)`

   for Windows:

   > `Right-click > Copy > Copy all as curl (cmd)`

   ![Copy as CURL](/img/gdrive3.png "You can even copy as NodeJS fetch")
5. In your (Unix) server, type **paste** the copied curl to a file, with 

   > ~$nano gdrive 

   or paste into terminal:

   > `~$"paste here" > gdrive` 

   (this will relocate the content you paste to a file) 
6. after the copy pasted command was there on the file, type 

   > `~$ sh ./gdrive > [filename.ext]`, 

   this will write the buffered stream to a file name and extension of your choice.



So in example if I want to download **test.rar**, then i would do `~$ sh ./pastedcurl > test.rar`, 

It works because the file requested by the Google Drive Server has the *Ã‡ontent-Type/MIME* of source file, all we need is to stream those buffered request into a file.

Well that's all how i manage to Mirror Google Drive File to UNIX Server with WGET / CURL, after awhile seeking a known method which turns out, nothing is work but this. Hope it's helpful.
